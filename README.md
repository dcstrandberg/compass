# compass
A simple app to test out my geolocation functions
Currently has an off/on button to test basic CSS functions and modifying them from JS. 
Functionality: 
Displays the distance in meters from your current location (high accuracy, updates with watchPosition() function) to Grand & Hamline.

Future updates: 
-Figure out if I can make the distance update faster.
-Use JSON to tell you the distance between you and another user.
